# Married Women Income Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the income of married women using data from the Wooldridge Current Population Survey (CPS91) Database. The dataset contains information on 5,634 married women, out of which 3,286 are reported to be in the labor force. There are 24 variables providing insights into married women, their husbands, demographics, union membership, labor force participation, and parental status. The aim is to estimate the standard wages equation of women using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, also known as Linear Regression. Independent variables such as education level, years of experience, race, and ethnicity are used to predict the behavior of the dependent variable - income.
